        <h2>Concepts of Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
        <p>Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to allocate and release memory at runtime based on current needs.</p> 
        <p>This makes memory usage more efficient compared to static memory allocation, where the size is fixed at compile time.</p>

        <h2>How Memory Allocation Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory is requested and allocated in <b>blocks</b> during runtime.</li>
            <li>If a block with sufficient memory is found, it is <b>allocated</b> to the program.</li>
            <li>If the block is larger than needed, the remaining space is split into a new <b>free block</b>.</li>
            <li>When memory is no longer needed, the allocated block is freed.</li>
            <li>Any adjacent free blocks are <b>merged</b> to form a larger free block, preventing fragmentation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Linked Lists Manage Memory Blocks</h2>
        <p>A <strong>linked list</strong> is a sequence of nodes connected via pointers, used to store the memory blocks in our dynamic memory allocator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each node (block) stores:
                <ul>
                    <li>  Size: The amount of memory in the block.</li>
                    <li>  Status: Whether the block is free or allocated.</li>
                    <li>  Pointer (Next): A reference to the next block in the list.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The linked list allows us to efficiently traverse the memory blocks and find the best-fit block for allocation.</li>
            <li>During <b>allocation</b>, a block may be split, and during <b>freeing</b>, adjacent free blocks are merged.</li>
        </ul>
