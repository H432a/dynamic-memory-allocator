# Dynamic Memory Allocator : 
Project Link <a href="https://dynamic-memory-allocator.glitch.me" target="_blank">here</a>.
## Overview
This project implements a dynamic memory allocator using linked lists in Python. It includes features for memory allocation, freeing, merging of free blocks, and visualization of memory blocks in a web interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Efficiently allocates and frees memory blocks during runtime.
- **Linked List Structure**: Uses a linked list to manage memory blocks, allowing for efficient allocation and deallocation.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask for interacting with the memory allocator.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Dynamically visualizes memory blocks as a linked list based on user interactions.
